SnJake Baikal-Swin-Anime x2 is a custom ComfyUI node for upscaling anime/illustration images with a dedicated restoration model. Model in **experimental** state; V2 is slightly sharper and removes edge noise artifacts.

# Installation

The installation consists of two steps: installing the node and making the weights available.

## Step 1: Install the Node

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory.
   ```bash
   # Example for Windows
   cd D:\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\

   # Example for Linux
   cd ~/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SnJake/SnJake_Baikal_Swin_Anime.git
   ```
4. For standard ComfyUI installations (with venv):
    1. Make sure your ComfyUI virtual environment (`venv`) is activated.
    2. Navigate into the new node directory and install the requirements:
       ```bash
       cd SnJake_Baikal_Swin_Anime
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```
   For Portable ComfyUI installations:
    1. Navigate back to the **root** of your portable ComfyUI directory (e.g., `D:\ComfyUI_windows_portable`).
    2. Run the following command to use the embedded Python to install the requirements. *Do not activate any venv.*
       ```bash
       python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r ComfyUI\custom_nodes\SnJake_Baikal_Swin_Anime\requirements.txt
       ```

## Step 2: Model Weights

On first use the node can automatically download weights from the repository.

- Default weights location: `ComfyUI/models/anime_upscale/`

If you want to download manually:
1. Download the weights from [HF REPO](https://huggingface.co/SnJake/Baikal-Swin-Anime).
2. Place the file(s) into `ComfyUI/models/anime_upscale/`.

## Step 3: Restart

Restart ComfyUI completely. The node will appear under **`😎 SnJake/Upscale`**.

---

# Usage

The node menu path is **`😎 SnJake/Upscale`**.

## Inputs

- `weights_name`: Select weights from the dropdown (auto-download if missing).
- `image`: Source image.
- `tile`: Tile size for large images. Recommended 256-512. Set 0 to disable tiling.
- `overlap`: Tile overlap for smooth blending. Recommended 32-64.
- `amp`: Precision (`auto`, `bf16`, `fp16`, `none`).
- `device`: Device (`auto`, `cuda`, `cpu`).

## Outputs

- `image`: Upscaled image.

# Training Details
V1:
- Dataset: 40,000 images from Danbooru2024: https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepghs/danbooru2024
- Validation: 600 images
- Epochs: 70

V2: 
- Slightly sharper output, no edge noise artifacts.
- Epochs: 20 (For now)
- Dataset: 49,606 images from Danbooru2024: https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepghs/danbooru2024
- Perceptual backbone: convnextv2_tiny.fcmae_ft_in22k_in1k, fine‑tuned on anime to improve feature sensitivity.
- Loss schedule: gradual ramp‑in of perceptual/auxiliary losses for stable training.

V2.1:
- Removed Nearest from resample_methods
- Epochs: 30 (For now)

V2.2:
- 40 epochs
